OSmOSE toolkit
=====================


OSmOSE toolkit is an open source suite of tools written in python and dedicated to the management and analysis of data in :term:`underwater passive acoustics`. Among other key features, our toolkit has been adapted to be deployed on a cluster infrastructure; in OSmOSE, our production version runs on :term:`DATARMOR`, the cluster of `IFREMER <https://en.ifremer.fr/>`_. Here are a few indications to help you going through our documentation. Jump to

- :ref:`Getting started` if you want to **use as quickly as possible** our toolkit in a **standalone executable** way. After installing its newest stable version, this section will illustrate our toolkit through tutorials covering :ref:`basic use cases` ;

- :ref:`Tutorials` if you **start from scratch with tools like Github, Conda, bash and qsub**. We have not reinvented the wheel of writing another tutorial about those famous tools, instead we have selected for you resources that we have found useful starting with, and we have gathered all our tricks and custom solutions for problems more specific to our project ;

- :ref:`Going further` if you want to execute our codes in a **git-based development environment** with the intention of **contributing** or reusing them in another project. This section will also show you how you can build **application-specific workflows** with more :ref:`advanced use cases`;

- :ref:`On Datarmor` if you want to run our toolkit on the **Datarmor infrastructure**. Note that this is only available to **OSmOSE members** for the moment. Please contact `Dorian Cazau <mailto:dorian.cazau@ensta-bretagne.fr>`__ for information on how joining our team.
